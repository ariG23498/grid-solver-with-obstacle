# Grid Solver

This is a fun project that is directed towards a autonomous robotics challenge.

* You are given a N*N grid, there will be a `start` and an `end` position. The autonomous line follower robot needs to start from a node and travel to the ending node. 

* There will be obstacles present on some nodes. The autonomous bot needs to bypass the obstacles and still be able to reach the destination.
* After reaching the `end`, it needs to back track to the `starting node` with the `shortest path possible`.
